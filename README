The Cesar code is considered to be the oldest of substitution cipher algorithms,
given that Julius Caesar used it.

The technique is basic:

all you have to do is replace each letter of the text to be encrypted with the
letter that is located n places later in the alphabet (non-alphabetic characters
don’t change).

For example, if n is worth 3, A is replaced by D, B by E, C by F and so on.
“HERE IS A SIMPLE EXAMPLE!” then becomes “KHUH LV D VLPSOH HADPSOH!”
(with a key of 3).

You must handle null, negative and positive keys.
Write a program that takes a crypted file and a number as parameters,
and that decrypts the content of the file using the Cesar code
(with the number as key).

The real subject is to write a program to encrypt a file or
string and write the result in a file named ’crypt’.
To encrypt a file we will use the ’-f’ parameter, for a string we will use ’-s’.
Since it is a crypted file, nobody should be able to modify its contents,
that’s why your program should set the read-only rights to the ’crypt’ file.
Usage: ./cesar -f filename key OR ./cesar -s string key
